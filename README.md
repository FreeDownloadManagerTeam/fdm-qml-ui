FDM6 supports loading of custom interfaces by the use of the special command line argument.

3. Test your changes by launching FDM6 with the following parameters:

    fdm -qurl file:///PATH_TO_MAIN_QML_INSIDE_OF_LOCAL_REPOSITORY

    E.g. under Windows OS this can be something like:

4. Share your changes with all FDM6 users using our forum or by creating pull requests to our main repository. 


We'll publish some documentation regarding FDM API the UI code is using in case there will be enough interest from our users.
